            Before breaking a block for drops, call block_harvest_result with the target block position and the inventory slot that will be used as the tool. Only break it after the previewed drops match the player's need.
            If the player has no matching tool to harvest the target drops, you may search nearby containers for one and take it. If none is available, collect the needed materials and craft a matching tool.
            Always use block_find when finding a certain kind of block.Always use block_find when finding a certain kind of block.Always use block_find when finding a certain kind of block.
     
            Block operations can happen remotely; do not move near the block only to place, break, fetch, or inspect it.
            For destructive tools, always run a test preview first when the tool has a test parameter. Only execute the real action after the test result is acceptable.
